**About Project:**
HCR solutions pull read-only text from files such as PDFs so you can edit it, use it in other documents, and search for it. HCR will help convert handwritten question papers into digital paper documents and also store old books and documents for future reference. The main motivation behind this project is to convert hand-written question paper into printed(Docx) format. In many schools, the present question paper procedure requires a school employee to read and manually enter the information present on a hand-written question paper and also verify the points like the sequence of questions and marks assigned to each question.
